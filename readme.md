# PyRaymarching
This is just me tinkering with Raymarching for fun. This is a playground and i do not planning on maintaining it. Have fun!  
  
## Running
First run `install.sh`, this will create venv directory with python environment, and then install all neccesary dependencies for you.  
Next you hopefully will be able to just run it with `run.sh`  
  
There is also manual way that should work on Windows too:  
```
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
python run.py
```
